    <h5> Human Powered Vehicle (2020 cycle) </h5>
    <h6> Berkeley HPV Team, ongoing </h6>
    <div class="projectDesc">
      <p> Designing and manufacturing a bike capable of traveling 60 mph for the 2020 World
        Human Powered Speed Challenge. As the frame team lead, I am responsible for leading
        a team of five engineers to build the frame of the bike and integrate it with the drivetrain,
        fairing, and electronic systems.</p>

<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> The frame was initially designed in SolidWorks. It features a roll cage design to allow for stability
        while limiting the total weight. From there, after several rounds of prorotyping, it was manufactured in
        the Berkeley mechanical engineering machine shop. We cut and notched the tubes using a mill,
        band saw, and files, before the tubes were welded together. </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p> Unfortunately, the competition was cancelled and school machine shops closed due to the COVID-19
      pandemic. We are now focusing our sights on the 2021 ASME competition, for which I will be serving as team lead. </p>

    <h6> E 26 (3D Modeling for Design) Final Project, May 2019 </h6>
    <div class="projectDesc">
      <p> In a team of five, we used SolidWorks to design a wind turbine tower and blade to maximize
        stiffness and power generation within certain restraints.</p>
      <p> The final product reached a power efficiency 60% of the industry average.

      <p> <br> Designed and 3D printed a Nintendo Switch Joy Con controller wheel for driving games.
        I iterated through several designs, improving them to fit the controller better and to feel more comfortable
        when being used. </p>

    <div class="projectDesc">
      <p> Built a wooden piano rack for a piano in a Berkeley dorm. The wood was cut using
        a jigsaw, bandsaw, table saw and sander. Pieces were assembled using wood screws
        combined with reinforcing pieces as well as wood glue. </p>

    <h5> Phoenix </h5>
    <h6> Self-Published Novel, 2017-2018 </h6>
    <div class="projectDesc">
      <img src="resources/phoenix.jpg" alt="Phoenix cover" class = "phoenixPic">
      <p> I wrote Phoenix during my senior year of high school. Having more free time during my last two semesters of high school
        and wanting to challenge myself, I decided to attempt to write a novel. An english teacher I had told me that the
        best way to write a good book was to write bad one first, so one night, as I laid on my bed, I pulled out my notebook
        and began writing what would become the prologue of Phoenix. </p>

      <p> The novel is a coming of age story about a high school senior named Marcus living in a quiet town in the eastern US.
        After several events cause his life to fall apart, he embarks on an adventure across the country, taking him through
        places and events he never could have imagined experiencing. </p>

      <p> Beyond the journey that came with writing a 90 000 word novel, being able to self-publish the book through a Amazon's Createspace service was a great learning experience for me. I saw how easy it is to turn visions into reality and the
        feeling
        of being able to hold a hard copy of my book was amazing. I hope to continue to write in the future and can't wait to bring
        more of my ideas to life.
      </p>
      Phoenix can be found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1986666778" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.
