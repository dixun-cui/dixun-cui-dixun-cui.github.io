        <p> I wrote Phoenix during my senior year of high school. Having more free time during my last two semesters of high school
        and wanting to challenge myself, I decided to attempt to write a novel. An english teacher I had told me that the
        best way to write a good book was to write bad one first, so one night, as I laid on my bed, I pulled out my notebook
        and began writing what would become the prologue of Phoenix. </p>

        <p> The novel is a coming of age story about a high school senior named Marcus living in a quiet town in the eastern US.
        After several events cause his life to fall apart, he embarks on an adventure across the country, taking him through
        places and events he never could have imagined experiencing. </p>

        <p> Beyond the journey that came with writing the 90 000 word novel, being able to self-publish the book through a Amazon's Createspace service was a great learning experience for me. I saw how easy it is to turn visions into reality and the feeling
        of being able to hold a hard copy of my book was amazing. I hope to continue to write in the future and can't wait to bring
        more of my ideas to life.
      </p>
